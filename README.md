   - Extensions can capture login credentials, cookies, or personal data entered into websites.  
   - Some inject hidden keyloggers or trackers.

   - This data is often sold to advertisers or cybercriminals.

   - Extensions can inject unwanted ads, popups, or banners.  
   - They may redirect users to phishing or malicious websites.  

4. **Account Hijacking**  
   - With elevated permissions, extensions can access session tokens or cookies, leading to unauthorized account access.  

5. **System Exploits**  
   - Some extensions download malware or exploit browser vulnerabilities.  
   - They may use excessive CPU/memory, slowing down the system.  

6. **Financial Fraud**  
   - Extensions can hijack online banking sessions, replace wallet addresses in crypto transactions, or alter payment information.  

7. **Persistence & Evasion**  
   - Malicious add-ons sometimes re-install themselves, disguise their names, or update automatically with new malicious code.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion  
Malicious browser extensions pose serious risks such as data theft, privacy invasion, ad injection, and even financial fraud by abusing the broad permissions granted to them. Regularly reviewing and removing suspicious or unnecessary extensions not only improves browser performance but also strengthens overall security. To stay protected, users should keep only trusted add-ons, carefully check permissions, and make extension audits a routine part of their cybersecurity hygiene.
